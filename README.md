# CreditCardFraudDetection-using-DeepLearning
CreditCardFraudDetection using Deeplearning. My model achieved an accuracy of 99.83% I trained my model using Deep Neural Network. This model has six hidden layers. I implemented using keras and tensorflow as backend. It took me around 2 hours to train this model using my laptop's CPU. I got this famous dataset online. This is a massive dataset having 31 columns and 284807 rows. Basically this is a classification problem which tells whether a person has or may commit a fraud based on his details/attributes like Time, amount and other 28 attributes like Time, amount and 29 attributes which is kept confidential by the banks. I have used Adam optimizer for optimization and have used Sigmoid function in the output layer. This model learns the weights using ReLu activation function. The main principle behind this model is the Backpropagation.
